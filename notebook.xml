Summary: The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.</note><note timestamp="2025-03-20 10:33:20">cat is an animal.</note><note timestamp="2025-03-20 10:48:10">cat is an animal.</note><note timestamp="2025-03-20 11:16:17">Wikipedia: Cat

Summary: Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food. Milk contains many nutrients, including calcium and protein, as well as lactose and saturated fat. Immune factors and immune-modulating components in milk contribute to milk immunity. Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies and immune-modulating components that strengthen the immune system against many diseases. The US CDC agency recommends that children over the age of 12 months (the minimum age to stop giving breast milk or formula) should have two servings of dairy (milk) products a day, and more than six billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products.</note></topic><topic name="Java"><note timestamp="2025-03-20 11:15:20">Java is a programming language.</note><note timestamp="2025-03-20 11:23:24">Java is a programming language.</note><note timestamp="2025-03-20 11:30:34">Java is a programming language.</note><note timestamp="2025-03-20 11:38:05">Java is a programming language.</note></topic></notebook>
